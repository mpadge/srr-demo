# demo

This is a skeleton of an [`srr` statistics](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/srr)
package, intended developers to tweak as they like, in order to understand 
how the package's roclets work.

This `README.Rmd` file is here to demonstrate how to embed `srr` roclet tags.
These tags need to be within dedicated *code chunks*, like the following:

```{r srr-tags, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#' roxygen_block_name
#'
#' (Add some text if you like)
#'
#' @srrstats {G1.4} Here is a reference to a standard
#' @srrstats {G1.5} And here is a reference to another standard
```

Note the chunk contains only [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) lines,
and nothing else at all. Please change the `eval` and `echo` parameters to
see what happens when you knit the document.
